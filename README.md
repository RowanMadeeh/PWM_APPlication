#LED Intensity and Servo Motor Control
This project demonstrates how to control the intensity of an LED using Timer0 in FASTPWM mode and how to control the rotation degree of a servo motor using Timer1 in FASTPWM mode on the ATmega32 microcontroller.
IT utilizes the ATmega32 microcontroller to control the intensity of an LED and the rotation degree of a servo motor using hardware PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) functionality provided by Timer0 and Timer1 in FASTPWM mode, respectively.
The LED intensity can be adjusted by varying the duty cycle of the PWM signal generated by Timer0. The servo motor rotation degree can be controlled by setting the appropriate PWM value for Timer1, which corresponds to different degrees of rotation.
